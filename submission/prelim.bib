	title = {De novo clustering methods outperform reference-based methods for assigning {16S} {rRNA} gene sequences to operational taxonomic units},
	volume = {3},
	issn = {2167-8359},
	url = {https://peerj.com/articles/1487},
	doi = {10.7717/peerj.1487},
	abstract = {Background.
              16S rRNA gene sequences are routinely assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that are then used to analyze complex microbial communities. A number of methods have been employed to carry out the assignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences to OTUs leading to confusion over which method is optimal. A recent study suggested that a clustering method should be selected based on its ability to generate stable OTU assignments that do not change as additional sequences are added to the dataset. In contrast, we contend that the quality of the OTU assignments, the ability of the method to properly represent the distances between the sequences, is more important.
            
            
              Methods.
              Our analysis implemented six
              de novo
              clustering algorithms including the single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage, abundance-based greedy clustering, distance-based greedy clustering, and Swarm and the open and closed-reference methods. Using two previously published datasets we used the Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) to assess the stability and quality of OTU assignments.
            
            
              Results.
              The stability of OTU assignments did not reflect the quality of the assignments. Depending on the dataset being analyzed, the average linkage and the distance and abundance-based greedy clustering methods generated OTUs that were more likely to represent the actual distances between sequences than the open and closed-reference methods. We also demonstrated that for the greedy algorithms VSEARCH produced assignments that were comparable to those produced by USEARCH making VSEARCH a viable free and open source alternative to USEARCH. Further interrogation of the reference-based methods indicated that when USEARCH or VSEARCH were used to identify the closest reference, the OTU assignments were sensitive to the order of the reference sequences because the reference sequences can be identical over the region being considered. More troubling was the observation that while both USEARCH and VSEARCH have a high level of sensitivity to detect reference sequences, the specificity of those matches was poor relative to the true best match.
            
            
              Discussion.
              Our analysis calls into question the quality and stability of OTU assignments generated by the open and closed-reference methods as implemented in current version of QIIME. This study demonstrates that
              de novo
              methods are the optimal method of assigning sequences into OTUs and that the quality of these assignments needs to be assessed for multiple methods to identify the optimal clustering method for a particular dataset.},

	abstract = {Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of death among cancers in the United States. Although individuals diagnosed early have a greater than 90 \% chance of survival, more than one-third of individuals do not adhere to screening recommendations partly because the standard diagnostics, colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy, are expensive and invasive. Thus, there is a great need to improve the sensitivity of non-invasive tests to detect early stage cancers and adenomas. Numerous studies have identified shifts in the composition of the gut microbiota associated with the progression of CRC, suggesting that the gut microbiota may represent a reservoir of biomarkers that would complement existing non-invasive methods such as the widely used fecal immunochemical test (FIT).
Methods: We sequenced the 16S rRNA genes from the stool samples of 490 patients. We used the relative abundances of the bacterial populations within each sample to develop a random forest classification model that detects colonic lesions using the relative abundance of gut microbiota and the concentration of hemoglobin in stool.
Results: The microbiota-based random forest model detected 91.7 \% of cancers and 45.5 \% of adenomas while FIT alone detected 75.0 \% and 15.7 \%, respectively. Of the colonic lesions missed by FIT, the model detected 70.0 \% of cancers and 37.7 \% of adenomas. We confirmed known associations of Porphyromonas assaccharolytica, Peptostreptococcus stomatis, Parvimonas micra, and Fusobacterium nucleatum with CRC. Yet, we found that the loss of potentially beneficial organisms, such as members of the Lachnospiraceae, was more predictive for identifying patients with adenomas when used in combination with FIT.
Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the potential for microbiota analysis to complement existing screening methods to improve detection of colonic lesions.},

	abstract = {Assignment of 16S rRNA gene sequences to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) is a computational bottleneck in the process of analyzing microbial communities. Although this has been an active area of research, it has been difﬁcult to overcome the time and memory demands while improving the quality of the OTU assignments. Here, we developed a new OTU assignment algorithm that iteratively reassigns sequences to new OTUs to optimize the Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC), a measure of the quality of OTU assignments. To assess the new algorithm, OptiClust, we compared it to 10 other algorithms using 16S rRNA gene sequences from two simulated and four natural communities. Using the OptiClust algorithm, the MCC values averaged 15.2 and 16.5\% higher than the OTUs generated when we used the average neighbor and distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH, respectively. Furthermore, on average, OptiClust was 94.6 times faster than the average neighbor algorithm and just as fast as distance-based greedy clustering with VSEARCH. An empirical analysis of the efﬁciency of the algorithms showed that the time and memory required to perform the algorithm scaled quadratically with the number of unique sequences in the data set. The signiﬁcant improvement in the quality of the OTU assignments over previously existing methods will signiﬁcantly enhance downstream analysis by limiting the splitting of similar sequences into separate OTUs and merging of dissimilar sequences into the same OTU. The development of the OptiClust algorithm represents a signiﬁcant advance that is likely to have numerous other applications.},

	abstract = {Clostridium difﬁcile is the largest single cause of hospital-acquired infection in the United States. A major risk factor for Clostridium difﬁcile infection (CDI) is prior exposure to antibiotics, as they disrupt the gut bacterial community which protects from C. difﬁcile colonization. Multiple antibiotic classes have been associated with CDI susceptibility, many leading to distinct community structures stemming from variation in bacterial targets of action. These community structures present separate metabolic challenges to C. difﬁcile. Therefore, we hypothesized that the pathogen adapts its physiology to the nutrients within different gut environments. Utilizing an in vivo CDI model, we demonstrated that C. difﬁcile highly colonized ceca of mice pretreated with any of three antibiotics from distinct classes. Levels of C. difﬁcile spore formation and toxin activity varied between animals based on the antibiotic pretreatment. These physiologic processes in C. difﬁcile are partially regulated by environmental nutrient concentrations. To investigate metabolic responses of the bacterium in vivo, we performed transcriptomic analysis of C. difﬁcile from ceca of infected mice across pretreatments. This revealed heterogeneous expression in numerous catabolic pathways for diverse growth substrates. To assess which resources C. difﬁcile exploited, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model with a transcriptome-enabled metabolite scoring algorithm integrating network architecture. This platform identiﬁed nutrients that C. difﬁcile used preferentially between pretreatments, which were validated through untargeted mass spectrometry of each microbiome. Our results supported the hypothesis that C. difﬁcile inhabits alternative nutrient niches across cecal microbiomes with increased preference for nitrogencontaining carbon sources, particularly Stickland fermentation substrates and hostderived glycans.},

            Rapid advances in sequencing technology have changed the experimental landscape of microbial ecology. In the last 10 years, the field has moved from sequencing hundreds of 16S rRNA gene fragments per study using clone libraries to the sequencing of millions of fragments per study using next-generation sequencing technologies from 454 and Illumina. As these technologies advance, it is critical to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and overall suitability of these platforms for the interrogation of microbial communities. Here, we present an improved method for sequencing variable regions within the 16S rRNA gene using Illumina's MiSeq platform, which is currently capable of producing paired 250-nucleotide reads. We evaluated three overlapping regions of the 16S rRNA gene that vary in length (i.e., V34, V4, and V45) by resequencing a mock community and natural samples from human feces, mouse feces, and soil. By titrating the concentration of 16S rRNA gene amplicons applied to the flow cell and using a quality score-based approach to correct discrepancies between reads used to construct contigs, we were able to reduce error rates by as much as two orders of magnitude. Finally, we reprocessed samples from a previous study to demonstrate that large numbers of samples could be multiplexed and sequenced in parallel with shotgun metagenomes. These analyses demonstrate that our approach can provide data that are at least as good as that generated by the 454 platform while providing considerably higher sequencing coverage for a fraction of the cost.},

Beyond its success and impact on the field, mothur's development exposed a series of observations that are generally translatable across science. Perhaps the observation that stands out the most is that all science is done in the context of prevailing ideas and available technologies. Although it is easy to criticize choices that were made 10 years ago through a modern lens, if we were to wait for all of the possible limitations to be solved before proceeding, science would stall. Even preceding the development of mothur, it was necessary to address the most important problems and work backwards to other problems that limited access to robust sequence analysis tools. At the same time, we strive to expand mothur's capabilities in a data-driven manner to incorporate new ideas and accommodate changes in data and desires of the research community. It has been edifying to see the benefit that a simple set of tools can bring to so many other researchers.},

More recently, the field has expanded to include investigation of complex microbial samples, such as understanding chemical communication in host-microbe systems or metabolite exchange in environmentally-derived microbiome samples, including utilizing these studies to direct drug discovery efforts from complex systems. This shift has required parallel modifications in methodology and techniques, including a substantive move toward untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics, although significant challenges limit the widespread use of metabolomic analysis for microbiome samples. Herein we describe parameters for LC-MS/MS sample handling, data acquisition, data analysis, and verification and related freely-available software that specifically impact analysis of complex microbial systems. Continued optimization of instrumentation, parameters, and software will allow metabolomics to more accurately represent chemical exchange in microbiome systems, providing enhanced understanding of their molecular potential.},

In addition to the well-known risk factors of behavior, diet, and genetics, gut microbial communities were recently identified as another possible source of risk and a potential therapeutic target. However, human and animal-model studies have yielded conflicting results about the precise nature of associations between microbiome composition and obesity. In this paper, we use publicly available data from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and MetaHIT, both surveys of healthy adults that include obese individuals, plus two smaller studies that specifically examined lean versus obese adults. We find that inter-study variability in the taxonomic composition of stool microbiomes far exceeds differences between lean and obese individuals within studies. Our analyses further reveal a high degree of variability in stool microbiome composition and diversity across individuals. While we confirm the previously published small, but statistically significant, differences in phylum-level taxonomic composition between lean and obese individuals in several cohorts, we find no association between BMI and taxonomic composition of stool microbiomes in the larger HMP and MetaHIT datasets. We explore a range of different statistical techniques and show that this result is robust to the choice of methodology. Differences between studies are likely due to a combination of technical and clinical factors. We conclude that there is no simple taxonomic signature of obesity in the microbiota of the human gut.},

Stool samples were collected from healthy adults (n = 10) and colorectal cancer patients (n = 11) prior to colon resection surgery at the University of Colorado Health-Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, CO. The V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene was pyrosequenced and both short chain fatty acids and global stool metabolites were extracted and analyzed utilizing Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). There were no significant differences in the overall microbial community structure associated with the disease state, but several bacterial genera, particularly butyrate-producing species, were under-represented in the CRC samples, while a mucin-degrading species, Akkermansia muciniphila, was about 4-fold higher in CRC (p{\textless}0.01). Proportionately higher amounts of butyrate were seen in stool of healthy individuals while relative concentrations of acetate were higher in stools of CRC patients. GC-MS profiling revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples from CRC patients and higher poly and monounsaturated fatty acids and ursodeoxycholic acid, a conjugated bile acid in stool samples from healthy adults (p{\textless}0.01). Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species. These associations could provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer environment and will help direct future mechanistic studies.

The bacterial toxin colibactin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and is associated with the occurrence of bacterially induced colorectal cancer in humans. However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks, which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks+E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane “warhead” breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks+E. coli.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONMembers of the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These CRC-associated microorganisms may influence carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of genotoxins. Colibactin is a genotoxic secondary metabolite made by organisms harboring the pks genomic island, including certain gut commensal Escherichia coli strains (pks+ E. coli). Transient infection of mammalian cells with pks+ E. coli causes cell cycle arrest, DNA double-strand breaks, and senescence. Moreover, colibactin-producing E. coli accelerate tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC and are overrepresented in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and CRC. Despite colibactin’s strong links to cancer, the active genotoxic metabolite has eluded all isolation attempts, limiting our mechanistic understanding of this association.
RATIONALEOver the past decade, multiple complementary approaches have provided indirect information about colibactin’s chemical structure. Interestingly, the isolation and structural characterization of metabolites from mutant strains of pks+ E. coli revealed that colibactin likely contains a cyclopropane ring, a reactive structural motif found in DNA alkylating natural products. This led us and others to hypothesize that colibactin may covalently modify DNA. To obtain information about the active genotoxin’s chemical structure and its mode of action, we sought to identify and structurally characterize colibactin-DNA adducts from human cells infected with pks+ E. coli.
RESULTSUsing untargeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry–based DNA adductomics, we compared the DNA adducts present in mammalian cell lines transiently infected with either pks+ E. coli or a mutant strain missing the pks genes. We discovered two adenine adducts that were specific to the cells exposed to pks+ E. coli. These adducts were confirmed to be pks-associated by feeding isotopic labeled versions of known colibactin biosynthetic precursors to the E. coli–mammalian cell system. The pks-dependent adducts were also found in human cells exposed to clinical colibactin-producing E. coli isolates and in the colonic epithelial cells of mice monocolonized with pks+ E. coli. Chemical synthesis and in vitro DNA alkylation reactions enabled the preparation of an authentic standard of the adducts. Structural characterization revealed a mixture of two diastereomeric adducts that both contain a 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one ring system with an attached N3-substituted adenine ring. These DNA adducts are generated from ring opening of a reactive, cyclopropane-containing electrophilic warhead, confirming the importance of this structural feature for colibactin’s in vivo activity. Because these adducts are too small to derive from the final colibactin structure, we hypothesize that they arise from decomposition of a larger, unstable colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-link. Using a CometChip assay, we detected interstrand cross-link formation in cells infected with pks+ E. coli at the same time point at which we identified the characterized DNA adducts, supporting this proposal.
CONCLUSIONOur results provide direct evidence that the gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo, providing mechanistic insights into how colibactin may contribute to CRC. The ability of pks+ E. coli to generate DNA adducts in mammalian cells and in mice strengthens support for the involvement of colibactin in cancer development or progression. Bulky DNA adducts, especially interstrand cross-links, are often cytotoxic and can lead to mutations if not accurately repaired. Colibactin-mediated DNA damage and the ensuing genomic instability could thus potentially be an underlying mediator of colorectal carcinogenesis. The colibactin-derived DNA adducts we identified could serve as a biomarker of pks+ E. coli exposure and will ultimately help to address the question of whether DNA damage inflicted by colibactin-producing gut bacteria contributes to CRC development and progression in humans. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6428/eaar7785/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Gut commensal E. coli strains associated with CRC produce a DNA-alkylating genotoxin.(Top) The cyclopropane ring found in pks-dependent metabolites led us to hypothesize that colibactin alkylates DNA.

These adducts also form in mice colonized with pks+ E. coli, confirming that colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo and strengthening its link to cancer.
Certain Escherichia coli strains residing in the human gut produce colibactin, a small-molecule genotoxin implicated in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. However, colibactin’s chemical structure and the molecular mechanism underlying its genotoxic effects have remained unknown for more than a decade. Here we combine an untargeted DNA adductomics approach with chemical synthesis to identify and characterize a covalent DNA modification from human cell lines treated with colibactin-producing E. coli. Our data establish that colibactin alkylates DNA with an unusual electrophilic cyclopropane. We show that this metabolite is formed in mice colonized by colibactin-producing E. coli and is likely derived from an initially formed, unstable colibactin-DNA adduct. Our findings reveal a potential biomarker for colibactin exposure and provide mechanistic insights into how a gut microbe may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.
DNA adducts in cells and animals exposed to colibactin-producing gut microbes shed light on the mode of action of a cancer-linked genotoxin.

An effective screening program leading to early detection of disease would severely reduce the mortality of CRC. Alterations in the gut microbiota have been linked to CRC, but the potential of microbial markers for use in CRC screening has been largely unstudied. We used a nested case–control study of 238 study subjects to explore the use of microbial markers for clbA+ bacteria harboring the pks pathogenicity island, afa-C+ diffusely adherent Escherichia coli harboring the afa-1 operon, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in stool as potential screening markers for CRC. We found that individual markers for clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum were more abundant in stool of patients with CRC, and could predict cancer with a relatively high specificity (81.5\% and 76.9\%, respectively) and with a sensitivity of 56.4\% and 69.2\%, respectively. In a combined test of clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum, CRC was detected with a specificity of 63.1\% and a sensitivity of 84.6\%. Our findings support a potential value of microbial factors in stool as putative noninvasive biomarkers for CRC detection. We propose that microbial markers may represent an important future screening strategy for CRC, selecting patients with a “high-risk” microbial pattern to other further diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy.},

Notably, the genomic contexts of colibactin-induced DNA double-strand breaks were enriched for an AT-rich hexameric sequence motif, associated with distinct DNA-shape characteristics. A survey of somatic mutations at colibactin target sites of several thousand cancer genomes revealed notable enrichment of this motif in colorectal cancers. Moreover, the exact double-strand-break loci corresponded with mutational hot spots in cancer genomes, reminiscent of a trinucleotide signature previously identified in healthy colorectal epithelial cells3.

Different microbial metabolites have the potential to promote and protect against colorectal cancer (CRC).Accumulating evidence suggests that microbial-derived short chain fatty acids control inflammation and regulatory T cell populations. This involves the inhibition of host histone deacetylases and interactions with cell surface receptors.Multiple species in the gut microbiota have complex roles in releasing and converting diet-derived phytochemicals and host-derived bile acids and glycoconjugates, all of which influence the overall microbial metabolome.Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota can be detected both in faecal samples and in tumour-associated communities that are associated with CRC. Although many of these changes may be consequential, some specific pathogens seem to contribute to causation and disease progression.It is unlikely that the aetiology of CRC can be ascribed to the presence and activities of single pathogenic species, and it is proposed that the cumulative effects of microbial metabolites should be considered to better predict and prevent cancer progression.},

On the one hand, many coexisting but taxonomically distinct microorganisms can encode the same energy-yielding metabolic functions, and this functional redundancy contrasts with the expectation that species should occupy distinct metabolic niches. On the other hand, the identity of taxa encoding each function can vary substantially across space or time with little effect on the function, and this taxonomic variability is frequently thought to result from ecological drift between equivalent organisms. Here, we synthesize the powerful paradigm emerging from these two patterns, connecting the roles of function, functional redundancy and taxonomy in microbial systems. We conclude that both patterns are unlikely to be the result of ecological drift, but are inevitable emergent properties of open microbial systems resulting mainly from biotic interactions and environmental and spatial processes.},

	abstract = {Results from microbiome studies on oral cancer have been inconsistent, probably because they focused on compositional analysis, which does not account for functional redundancy among oral bacteria. Based on functional prediction, a recent study revealed enrichment of inflammatory bacterial attributes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Given the high relevance of this finding to carcinogenesis, we aimed here to corroborate them in a case-control study involving 25 OSCC cases and 27 fibroepithelial polyp (FEP) controls from Sri Lanka. DNA extracted from fresh biopsies was sequenced for the V1 to V3 region with Illumina?s 2 ? 300?bp chemistry. High-quality nonchimeric merged reads were classified to the species level with a prioritized BLASTN-based algorithm. Downstream compositional analysis was performed with QIIME (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology) and linear discriminant analysis effect size, while PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) was utilized for bacteriome functional prediction. The OSCC tissues tended to have lower species richness and diversity. Genera Capnocytophaga, Pseudomonas, and Atopobium were overrepresented in OSCC, while Lautropia, Staphylococcus, and Propionibacterium were the most abundant in FEP. At the species level, Campylobacter concisus, Prevotella salivae, Prevotella loeschii, and Fusobacterium oral taxon 204 were enriched in OSCC, while Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oral taxon 070, Lautropia mirabilis, and Rothia dentocariosa among others were more abundant in FEP. Functionally, proinflammatory bacterial attributes, including lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and peptidases, were enriched in the OSCC tissues. Thus, while the results in terms of species composition significantly differed from the original study, they were consistent at the functional level, substantiating evidence for the inflammatory nature of the bacteriome associated with OSCC.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiome is a complex microbial community that plays a key role in human health. Diet is an important factor dictating gut microbiome composition. This is mediated by multiple microbe-microbe interactions that result in the fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids. Certain species play key metabolic roles in the microbiome, and their disappearance could result in dysbiosis. In this work, a synthetic consortium of 14 gut microbes was studied during the utilization of prebiotic inulin in batch bioreactors. Fermentations were repeated leaving one species out every time, in order to evaluate the impact of their elimination on the system. Substrate consumption, microbial composition, and metabolite production were determined. Single deletions never resulted in a complete loss of bacterial growth or inulin consumption, suggesting functional redundancy. Deletions of Bacteroides dorei and Lachnoclostridium clostridioforme resulted in lower biomass and higher residual inulin. The absence of B. dorei impacted the abundance of the other 10 species negatively. Lachnoclostridium symbiosum, a butyrate producer, appeared to be the most sensitive species to deletions, being stimulated by the presence of Escherichia coli, Biﬁdobacterium adolescentis, B. dorei, and Lactobacillus plantarum. Conversely, bioreactors without these species did not show butyrate production. L. clostridioforme was observed to be essential for propionate production, and B. dorei for lactate production. Our analysis identiﬁed speciﬁc members that were essential for the function of the consortium. In conclusion, species deletions from microbial consortia could be a useful approach to identify relevant interactions between microorganisms and deﬁning metabolic roles in the gut microbiome.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Although functional redundancy has received increased attention in the microbial ecology literature, no quantitative functional redundancy measurement is currently available which compares multiple communities and integrates of ‘omics data rather than phenotypic traits. Here, we propose an approach for quantifying functional redundancy that use ‘omics data. This approach, termed trait contribution evenness (TCE), is based on traditional measures of community diversity. We measure functional redundancy of a trait within a community as the evenness in relative contribution of that trait among taxa within the community. This definition has several appealing properties including: TCE is an extension of established diversity theory, functional redundancy measurements from communities with different richness and relative trait contribution by taxa are easily comparable, and any quantifiable trait data (genes copies, protein abundance, transcript copies, respiration rates, etc.) is suitable for analysis. Resilience of a trait to taxa extinctions is often viewed as an ecological consequence of traits with high functional redundancy. We demonstrate that TCE functional redundancy is closely and monotonically related to the resilience of a trait to extinctions of trait-bearing taxa. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of TCE, we analyzed the functional redundancy of eight nitrogen-transforming pathways using 2,631 metagenome-assembled genomes from 47 TARA Oceans sites. We found that the NH$_{\textrm{4}}$$^{\textrm{+}}$ assimilation pathway was the most functionally redundant (0.6 to 0.7) while nitrification had the lowest functional redundancy (0 to 0.1). Here, TCE functional redundancy addresses shortfalls of other functional redundancy measurements by providing a generalizable, quantitative, and comparable functional redundancy measurement.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Importance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The broad application of ‘omics technologies in microbiological studies highlights the necessity of integrating traditional ecological theory with omics data when quantifying community functional redundancy. Such an approach should allow for comparisons in functional redundancy between different samples, sites, and studies. Here, we propose measuring functional redundancy based on an expansion of already existing diversity theory. This approach measures how evenly different members in a community contribute to the overall level of a trait within a community. The utility in the approach proposed here will allow for broad evaluation of traits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) modeling of the human microbiome has the potential to identify microbial biomarkers and aid in the diagnosis of many diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and colorectal cancer. Progress has been made toward developing ML models that predict health outcomes using bacterial abundances, but inconsistent adoption of training and evaluation methods call the validity of these models into question. Furthermore, there appears to be a preference by many researchers to favor increased model complexity over interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we trained seven models that used fecal 16S rRNA sequence data to predict the presence of colonic screen relevant neoplasias (SRNs) (n = 490 patients, 261 controls and 229 cases). We developed a reusable open-source pipeline to train, validate, and interpret ML models. To show the effect of model selection, we assessed the predictive performance, interpretability, and training time of L2-regularized logistic regression, L1- and L2-regularized support vector machines (SVM) with linear and radial basis function kernels, a decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). The random forest model performed best at detecting SRNs with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.695 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.651 to 0.739) but was slow to train (83.2 h) and not inherently interpretable. Despite its simplicity, L2-regularized logistic regression followed random forest in predictive performance with an AUROC of 0.680 (IQR, 0.625 to 0.735), trained faster (12 min), and was inherently interpretable. Our analysis highlights the importance of choosing an ML approach based on the goal of the study, as the choice will inform expectations of performance and interpretability.
IMPORTANCE Diagnosing diseases using machine learning (ML) is rapidly being adopted in microbiome studies. However, the estimated performance associated with these models is likely overoptimistic. Moreover, there is a trend toward using black box models without a discussion of the difficulty of interpreting such models when trying to identify microbial biomarkers of disease. This work represents a step toward developing more-reproducible ML practices in applying ML to microbiome research. We implement a rigorous pipeline and emphasize the importance of selecting ML models that reflect the goal of the study. These concepts are not particular to the study of human health but can also be applied to environmental microbiology studies.},

The gene set, ∼150 times larger than the human gene complement, contains an overwhelming majority of the prevalent (more frequent) microbial genes of the cohort and probably includes a large proportion of the prevalent human intestinal microbial genes. The genes are largely shared among individuals of the cohort. Over 99\% of the genes are bacterial, indicating that the entire cohort harbours between 1,000 and 1,150 prevalent bacterial species and each individual at least 160 such species, which are also largely shared. We define and describe the minimal gut metagenome and the minimal gut bacterial genome in terms of functions present in all individuals and most bacteria, respectively.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiome is the resident microbial community of the gastrointestinal tract. This community is highly diverse, but how microbial diversity confers resistance or susceptibility to intestinal pathogens is poorly understood. Using transplantation of human microbiomes into several animal models of infection, we show that key microbiome species shape the chemical environment of the gut through the activity of the enzyme bile salt hydrolase. The activity of this enzyme reduced colonization by the major human diarrheal pathogen Vibrio cholerae by degrading the bile salt taurocholate that activates the expression of virulence genes. The absence of these functions and species permits increased infection loads on a personal microbiome-speciﬁc basis. These ﬁndings suggest new targets for individualized preventative strategies of V. cholerae infection through modulating the structure and function of the gut microbiome.},

A coherent taxonomic framework can be obtained with both targeted or untargeted approaches. Targeted approaches have dominated the meta-analyses for a long time, providing great insights into the structure and the dynamics of microbial populations. Such information is precious for verifying, complementing or even integrating the results obtained with metagenomics. In fact, taxonomic accuracy is a crucial aspect of every meta-approach. A multitude of methods have been proposed aimed at extracting taxonomic/phylogenetic information from untargeted sequencing, with the aim of reconstructing and evaluating the genomic complexity of environments. Yet, methods for targeted taxonomic profiling, although relatively poor in terms of achievable taxonomic depth, can give a broader perspective on microbial populations with respect to metagenomics. This chapter is therefore dedicated to the role of targeted approaches, in particular those related to 16S rRNA, in the advancing field of metagenomic knowledge.},

However, there is no all-purpose strategy that can guarantee the best result for a given project and there are several combinations of software, parameters and databases that can be tested. Therefore, we performed an impartial comparison, using statistical measures of classification for eight bioinformatic tools and four taxonomic databases, defining a benchmark framework to evaluate each tool in a standardized context. Using in silico simulated data for 16S rRNA amplicons and whole metagenome shotgun data, we compared the results from different software and database combinations to detect biases related to algorithms or database annotation. Using our benchmark framework, researchers can define cut-off values to evaluate the expected error rate and coverage for their results, regardless the score used by each software. A quick guide to select the best tool, all datasets and scripts to reproduce our results and benchmark any new method are available at https://github.com/Ales-ibt/Metagenomic-benchmark.

Several methods for taxonomic classification of bacterial sequences are discussed. We present simulations to assess the number of sequences that are required to perform reliable appraisals of bacterial community structure.

	abstract = {Recent research has disclosed a tight connection between obesity, metabolic gut microbial activities and host health. Obtaining a complete understanding of this relationship remains a major goal. Here, we conducted a comparative metagenomic and metaproteomic investigation of gut microbial communities in faecal samples taken from an obese and a lean adolescent. By analysing the diversity of 16S rDNA amplicons (10\% operational phylogenetic units being common), 22 Mbp of consensus metagenome sequences (∼ 70\% common) and the expression profiles of 613 distinct proteins (82\% common), we found that in the obese gut, the total microbiota was more abundant on the phylum Firmicutes (94.6\%) as compared with Bacteroidetes (3.2\%), although the metabolically active microbiota clearly behaves in a more homogeneous manner with both contributing equally. The lean gut showed a remarkable shift towards Bacteroidetes (18.9\% total 16S rDNA), which become the most active fraction (81\% proteins). Although the two gut communities maintained largely similar gene repertoires and functional profiles, improved pili- and flagella-mediated host colonization and improved capacity for both complementary aerobic and anaerobic de novo B12 synthesis, 1,2-propanediol catabolism (most likely participating in de novo B12 synthesis) and butyrate production were observed in the obese gut, whereas bacteria from lean gut seem to be more engaged in vitamin B6 synthesis. Furthermore, this study provides functional evidence that variable combinations of species from different phyla could ‘presumptively’ fulfil overlapping and/or complementary functional roles required by the host, a scenario where minor bacterial taxa seem to be significant active contributors.},

Here we utilized metagenomic libraries of crustal fluid samples from North Pond, located on the flanks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a site with cold, oxic subseafloor fluid circulation within the upper basement to query microbial diversity. Twenty-one samples were collected during a 2-year period to examine potential microbial metabolism and community dynamics. We observed minor changes in the geochemical signatures over the 2 years, yet the microbial community present in the crustal fluids underwent large shifts in the dominant taxonomic groups. An analysis of 195 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were generated from the data set and revealed a connection between litho- and autotrophic processes, linking carbon fixation to the oxidation of sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, hydrogen, and ferrous iron in members of the Proteobacteria, specifically the Alpha-, Gamma- and Zetaproteobacteria, the Epsilonbacteraeota and the Planctomycetes. Despite oxic conditions, analysis of the MAGs indicated that members of the microbial community were poised to exploit hypoxic or anoxic conditions through the use of microaerobic cytochromes, such as cbb3- and bd-type cytochromes, and alternative electron acceptors, like nitrate and sulfate. Temporal and spatial trends from the MAGs revealed a high degree of functional redundancy that did not correlate with the shifting microbial community membership, suggesting functional stability in mediating subseafloor biogeochemical cycles. Collectively, the repeated sampling at multiple sites, together with the successful binning of hundreds of genomes, provides an unprecedented data set for investigation of microbial communities in the cold, oxic crustal aquifer.},

Differences were detected between NT and CT in some functional subsystems, e.g., NT had more sequences associated with the metabolism of aromatic compounds, which might be related to higher capacity to degrade pesticides, more sequences of the adenylate cyclase (cAMP) pathway, which might confer stability to the microbial community, among others. On the other hand, CT showed more sequences related to carbohydrate metabolism, what could be related with a lower content of organic matter and need to metabolize a broader range of carbon sources. Also, we detected differences related to crop management, e.g., crop rotation showed more sequences in the metabolism of amino acids and derivatives and carbohydrate subsystems, what might result from higher diversity of crop-residues added to the soil. However, it was notable that the differences in the diversity of taxa previously shown in the same experiment was far greater than the functional diversity reported now, emphasizing a high level of microbial functional redundancy.},

	abstract = {Human viruses (those that infect human cells) have been associated with many cancers, largely due to their mutagenic and functionally manipulative abilities. Despite this, cancer microbiome studies have focused almost exclusively on bacteria instead of viruses. We began evaluating the cancer virome by focusing on colorectal cancer, a primary cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world and a cancer linked to altered colonic bacterial community compositions but with an unknown association with the gut virome. We used 16S rRNA gene, whole shotgun metagenomic, and purified virus metagenomic sequencing of stool to evaluate the differences in human colorectal cancer virus and bacterial community composition. Through random forest modeling, we identified differences in the healthy and colorectal cancer viromes. The cancer-associated virome consisted primarily of temperate bacteriophages that were also predicted to be bacterium-virus community network hubs. These results provide foundational evidence that bacteriophage communities are associated with colorectal cancer and potentially impact cancer progression by altering the bacterial host communities.
IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and worldwide. Its risk and severity have been linked to colonic bacterial community composition. Although human-specific viruses have been linked to other cancers and diseases, little is known about colorectal cancer virus communities. We addressed this knowledge gap by identifying differences in colonic virus communities in the stool of colorectal cancer patients and how they compared to bacterial community differences. The results suggested an indirect role for the virome in impacting colorectal cancer by modulating the associated bacterial community. These findings both support the idea of a biological role for viruses in colorectal cancer and provide a new understanding of basic colorectal cancer etiology.},

	abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that plant community composition is key for predicting rates of ecosystem processes in the face of global change, microbial community composition is often ignored in ecosystem modeling. To address this issue, we review recent experiments and assess whether microbial community composition is resistant, resilient, or functionally redundant in response to four different disturbances. We find that the composition of most microbial groups is sensitive and not immediately resilient to disturbance, regardless of taxonomic breadth of the group or the type of disturbance. Other studies demonstrate that changes in composition are often associated with changes in ecosystem process rates. Thus, changes in microbial communities due to disturbance may directly affect ecosystem processes. Based on these relationships, we propose a simple framework to incorporate microbial community composition into ecosystem process models. We conclude that this effort would benefit from more empirical data on the links among microbial phylogeny, physiological traits, and disturbance responses. These relationships will determine how readily microbial community composition can be used to predict the responses of ecosystem processes to global change.},

Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable.

When comparing two or more populations most existing approaches either discount the underlying compositional structure in the microbiome data or use probability models such as the multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may impose a correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data.ObjectiveTo develop a methodology that accounts for compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in detecting differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level, while maintaining high statistical power.MethodsWe introduced a novel statistical framework called analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear model framework to adjust for covariates as well as model longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples involving thousands of taxa.ResultsWe compared the performance of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology (1) for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as 68\% for the t-test and 60\% for ZIG. We illustrate the performance of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial datasets in the human gut, demonstrating its general applicability to testing hypotheses about compositional differences in microbial communities.ConclusionAccounting for compositionality using log-ratio analysis results in significantly improved inference in microbiota survey data.},

We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P {\textless} 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies.},

	abstract = {Background: Alterations of gut microbiota are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) in different populations and several bacterial species were found to contribute to the tumorigenesis. The potential use of gut microbes as markers for early diagnosis has also been reported. However, cohort specific noises may distort the structure of microbial dysbiosis in CRC and lead to inconsistent results among studies. In this regard, our study targeted at exploring changes in gut microbiota that are universal across populations at species level.
Results: Based on the combined analysis of 526 metagenomic samples from Chinese, Austrian, American, and German and French cohorts, seven CRC-enriched bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella intermedia, Alistipes finegoldii, and Thermanaerovibrio acidaminovorans) have been identified across populations. The seven enriched bacterial markers classified cases from controls with an area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.80 across the different populations. Abundance correlation analysis demonstrated that CRC-enriched and CRC-depleted bacteria respectively formed their own mutualistic networks, in which the latter was disjointed in CRC. The CRC-enriched bacteria have been found to be correlated with lipopolysaccharide and energy biosynthetic pathways.
Conclusions: Our study identified potential diagnostic bacterial markers that are robust across populations, indicating their potential universal use for non-invasive CRC diagnosis. We also elucidated the ecological networks and functional capacities of CRC-associated microbiota.},

	abstract = {Analysis of human body microbial diversity is fundamental to understanding community structure, biology and ecology. The National Institutes of Health Human Microbiome Project (HMP) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine microbial diversity within and across body habitats and individuals through pyrosequencing-based profiling of 16 S rRNA gene sequences (16 S) from habits of the oral, skin, distal gut, and vaginal body regions from over 200 healthy individuals enabling the application of statistical techniques. In this study, two approaches were applied to elucidate the nature and extent of human microbiome diversity. First, bootstrap and parametric curve fitting techniques were evaluated to estimate the maximum number of unique taxa, Smax, and taxa discovery rate for habitats across individuals. Next, our results demonstrated that the variation of diversity within low abundant taxa across habitats and individuals was not sufficiently quantified with standard ecological diversity indices. This impact from low abundant taxa motivated us to introduce a novel rank-based diversity measure, the Tail statistic, (‘‘t’’), based on the standard deviation of the rank abundance curve if made symmetric by reflection around the most abundant taxon. Due to t’s greater sensitivity to low abundant taxa, its application to diversity estimation of taxonomic units using taxonomic dependent and independent methods revealed a greater range of values recovered between individuals versus body habitats, and different patterns of diversity within habitats. The greatest range of t values within and across individuals was found in stool, which also exhibited the most undiscovered taxa. Oral and skin habitats revealed variable diversity patterns, while vaginal habitats were consistently the least diverse. Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance, and motivate the introduction, of several visualization and analysis methods tuned specifically for next-generation sequence data, further revealing that low abundant taxa serve as an important reservoir of genetic diversity in the human microbiome.},

The aim of this study was to investigate the taxonomic and functional temporal dynamics of airways microbiome in a cohort of CF patients. Multiple sputum samples were collected over 15 months from 22 patients with chronic \textit{P. aeruginosa} infection, for a total of 79 samples. DNA extracted from samples was subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing allowing either strain-level taxonomic profiling and assessment of the functional metagenomic repertoire. High inter-patient taxonomic heterogeneity was found with short-term compositional changes during exacerbations and following antibiotic treatment. Each patient exhibited distinct sputum microbial communities at the taxonomic level, and strain-specific colonization of traditional CF pathogens, including \textit{P. aeruginosa}, and emerging pathogens. Sputum microbiome was found to be extraordinarily resilient following antibiotic treatment, with rapid recovery of taxa and metagenome-associated gene functions. In particular, a large core set of genes, including antibiotic resistance genes, were shared across patients despite observed differences in clinical status or antibiotic treatment, and constantly detected in the lung microbiome of all subjects independently from known antibiotic exposure, suggesting an overall microbiome-associated functions stability despite taxonomic fluctuations of the communities.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}IMPORTANCE{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}While the dynamics of CF sputum microbial composition were highly patient-specific, the overall sputum metagenome composition was stable, showing a high resilience along time and antibiotic exposure.

	abstract = {A common biological pathway reconstruction approach—as implemented by many automatic biological pathway services (such as the KAAS and RAST servers) and the functional annotation of metagenomic sequences—starts with the identification of protein functions or families (e.g., KO families for the KEGG database and the FIG families for the SEED database) in the query sequences, followed by a direct mapping of the identified protein families onto pathways. Given a predicted patchwork of individual biochemical steps, some metric must be applied in deciding what pathways actually exist in the genome or metagenome represented by the sequences. Commonly, and straightforwardly, a complete biological pathway can be identified in a dataset if at least one of the steps associated with the pathway is found. We report, however, that this naïve mapping approach leads to an inflated estimate of biological pathways, and thus overestimates the functional diversity of the sample from which the DNA sequences are derived. We developed a parsimony approach, called MinPath (Minimal set of Pathways), for biological pathway reconstructions using protein family predictions, which yields a more conservative, yet more faithful, estimation of the biological pathways for a query dataset. MinPath identified far fewer pathways for the genomes collected in the KEGG database—as compared to the naïve mapping approach—eliminating some obviously spurious pathway annotations. Results from applying MinPath to several metagenomes indicate that the common methods used for metagenome annotation may significantly overestimate the biological pathways encoded by microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Metagenomics and marker gene approaches, coupled with high-throughput sequencing technologies, have revolutionized the field of microbial ecology. Metagenomics is a culture-independent method that allows the identification and characterization of organisms from all kinds of samples. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing analyses the total DNA of a chosen sample to determine the presence of micro-organisms from all domains of life and their genomic content. Importantly, the whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach reveals the genomic diversity present, but can also give insights into the functional potential of the micro-organisms identified. The marker gene approach is based on the sequencing of a specific gene region. It allows one to describe the microbial composition based on the taxonomic groups present in the sample. It is frequently used to analyse the biodiversity of microbial ecosystems. Despite its importance, the analysis of metagenomic sequencing and marker gene data is quite a challenge. Here we review the primary workflows and software used for both approaches and discuss the current challenges in the field.,},

	abstract = {Culture-independent methods have contributed substantially to our understanding of global microbial diversity. Recently developed algorithms to construct whole genomes from environmental samples have further refined, corrected and revolutionized understanding of the tree of life. Here, we assembled draft metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from environmental DNA extracted from two hot springs within an active volcanic ecosystem on the Kamchatka peninsula, Russia. This hydrothermal system has been intensively studied previously with regard to geochemistry, chemoautotrophy, microbial isolation, and microbial diversity. We assembled genomes of bacteria and archaea using DNA that had previously been characterized via 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. We recovered 36 MAGs, 29 of medium to high quality, and inferred their placement in a phylogenetic tree consisting of 3,240 publicly available microbial genomes. We highlight MAGs that were taxonomically assigned to groups previously underrepresented in available genome data. This includes several archaea (Korarchaeota, Bathyarchaeota and Aciduliprofundum) and one potentially new species within the bacterial genus Sulfurihydrogenibium. Putative functions in both pools were compared and are discussed in the context of their diverging geochemistry. This study adds comprehensive information about phylogenetic diversity and functional potential within two hot springs in the caldera of Kamchatka.},

	abstract = {Shotgun metagenomics is increasingly used to characterise microbial communities, particularly for the investigation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in different animal and environmental contexts. There are many different approaches for inferring the taxonomic composition and AMR gene content of complex community samples from shotgun metagenomic data, but there has been little work establishing the optimum sequencing depth, data processing and analysis methods for these samples. In this study we used shotgun metagenomics and sequencing of cultured isolates from the same samples to address these issues. We sampled three potential environmental AMR gene reservoirs (pig caeca, river sediment, effluent) and sequenced samples with shotgun metagenomics at high depth ({\textasciitilde} 200 million reads per sample). Alongside this, we cultured single-colony isolates of Enterobacteriaceae from the same samples and used hybrid sequencing (short- and long-reads) to create high-quality assemblies for comparison to the metagenomic data. To automate data processing, we developed an open-source software pipeline, ‘ResPipe’.},

	abstract = {Microbial community samples can be efficiently surveyed in high throughput by sequencing markers such as the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Often, a collection of samples is then selected for subsequent metagenomic, metabolomic or other follow-up. Two-stage study design has long been used in ecology but has not yet been studied in-depth for high-throughput microbial community investigations. To avoid ad hoc sample selection, we developed and validated several purposive sample selection methods for two-stage studies (that is, biological criteria) targeting differing types of microbial communities. These methods select follow-up samples from large community surveys, with criteria including samples typical of the initially surveyed population, targeting specific microbial clades or rare species, maximizing diversity, representing extreme or deviant communities, or identifying communities distinct or discriminating among environment or host phenotypes. The accuracies of each sampling technique and their influences on the characteristics of the resulting selected microbial community were evaluated using both simulated and experimental data. Specifically, all criteria were able to identify samples whose properties were accurately retained in 318 paired 16S amplicon and whole-community metagenomic (follow-up) samples from the Human Microbiome Project. Some selection criteria resulted in follow-up samples that were strongly non-representative of the original survey population; diversity maximization particularly undersampled community configurations. Only selection of intentionally representative samples minimized differences in the selected sample set from the original microbial survey. An implementation is provided as the microPITA (Microbiomes: Picking Interesting Taxa for Analysis) software for two-stage study design of microbial communities.},

	abstract = {In the early 1980s, a strategy for graphical representation of multivariate (multi-species) abundance data was introduced into marine ecology by, among others, Field, et al. (1982). A decade on, it is instructive to: (i) identify which elements of this often-quoted strategy have proved most useful in practical assessment of community change resulting from pollution impact; and (ii) ask to what extent evolution of techniques in the intervening years has added self-consistency and comprehensiveness to the approach. The pivotal concept has proved to be that of a biologically-relevant definition of similarity of two samples, and its utilization mainly in simple rank form, for example ‘sample A is more similar to sample B than it is to sample C’. Statistical assumptions about the data are thus minimized and the resulting non-parametric techniques will be of very general applicability. From such a starting point, a unified framework needs to encompass: (i) the display of community patterns through clustering and ordination of samples; (ii) identification of species principally responsible for determining sample groupings; (iii) statistical tests for differences in space and time (multivariate analogues of analysis of variance, based on rank similarities); and (iv) the linking of community differences to patterns in the physical and chemical environment (the latter also dictated by rank similarities between samples). Techniques are described that bring such a framework into place, and areas in which problems remain are identified. Accumulated practical experience with these methods is discussed, in particular applications to marine benthos, and it is concluded that they have much to offer practitioners of environmental impact studies on communities.},
