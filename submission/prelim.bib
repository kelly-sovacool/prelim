	abstract = {The advances in experimental methods and the development of high performance bioinformatic tools have substantially improved our understanding of microbial communities associated with human niches. Many studies have documented that changes in microbial abundance and composition of the human microbiome is associated with human health and diseased state. The majority of research on human microbiome is typically focused in the analysis of one level of biological information, i.e., metagenomics or metatranscriptomics. In this review, we describe some of the different experimental and bioinformatic strategies applied to analyze the 16S rRNA gene profiling and shotgun sequencing data of the human microbiome. We also discuss how some of the recent insights in the combination of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and viromics can provide more detailed description on the interactions between microorganisms and viruses in oral and gut microbiomes. Recent studies on viromics have begun to gain importance due to the potential involvement of viruses in microbial dysbiosis. In addition, metatranscriptomic combined with metagenomic analysis have shown that a substantial fraction of microbial transcripts can be differentially regulated relative to their microbial genomic abundances. Thus, understanding the molecular interactions in the microbiome using the combination of metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and viromics is one of the main challenges towards a system level understanding of human microbiome.},

This shift has required parallel modifications in methodology and techniques, including a substantive move toward untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics, although significant challenges limit the widespread use of metabolomic analysis for microbiome samples. Herein we describe parameters for LC-MS/MS sample handling, data acquisition, data analysis, and verification and related freely-available software that specifically impact analysis of complex microbial systems. Continued optimization of instrumentation, parameters, and software will allow metabolomics to more accurately represent chemical exchange in microbiome systems, providing enhanced understanding of their molecular potential.},

	abstract = {Obesity is an important and intractable public health problem. In addition to the well-known risk factors of behavior, diet, and genetics, gut microbial communities were recently identified as another possible source of risk and a potential therapeutic target. However, human and animal-model studies have yielded conflicting results about the precise nature of associations between microbiome composition and obesity. In this paper, we use publicly available data from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and MetaHIT, both surveys of healthy adults that include obese individuals, plus two smaller studies that specifically examined lean versus obese adults. We find that inter-study variability in the taxonomic composition of stool microbiomes far exceeds differences between lean and obese individuals within studies. Our analyses further reveal a high degree of variability in stool microbiome composition and diversity across individuals. While we confirm the previously published small, but statistically significant, differences in phylum-level taxonomic composition between lean and obese individuals in several cohorts, we find no association between BMI and taxonomic composition of stool microbiomes in the larger HMP and MetaHIT datasets. We explore a range of different statistical techniques and show that this result is robust to the choice of methodology. Differences between studies are likely due to a combination of technical and clinical factors. We conclude that there is no simple taxonomic signature of obesity in the microbiota of the human gut.},

A recent study revealed that in colon cancer, bacteria form polysaccharide matrices called biofilms at a high frequency in the proximal colon. Comprehensive untargeted and stable isotope-assisted metabolomic analysis revealed that the bacteria utilize polyamine metabolites produced from colon adenomas/carcinomas to build these protective biofilms and may contribute to inflammation and proliferation observed in colon cancer. This study highlighted the importance of finding the biological origin of a metabolite and assessing its metabolism and mechanism of action. This led to a better understanding of host and microbial interactions, thereby aiding therapeutic design for cancer. In this review, we will discuss methodologies for identifying the biological origin and roles of metabolites in cancer progression and discuss the interactions of the microbiome and metabolites in immunity and cancer treatment, focusing on the flourishing field of cancer immunotherapy.

	abstract = {In this study we used stool profiling to identify intestinal bacteria and metabolites that are differentially represented in humans with colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to healthy controls to identify how microbial functions may influence CRC development. Stool samples were collected from healthy adults (n = 10) and colorectal cancer patients (n = 11) prior to colon resection surgery at the University of Colorado Health-Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, CO. The V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene was pyrosequenced and both short chain fatty acids and global stool metabolites were extracted and analyzed utilizing Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). There were no significant differences in the overall microbial community structure associated with the disease state, but several bacterial genera, particularly butyrate-producing species, were under-represented in the CRC samples, while a mucin-degrading species, Akkermansia muciniphila, was about 4-fold higher in CRC (p{\textless}0.01). Proportionately higher amounts of butyrate were seen in stool of healthy individuals while relative concentrations of acetate were higher in stools of CRC patients. GC-MS profiling revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples from CRC patients and higher poly and monounsaturated fatty acids and ursodeoxycholic acid, a conjugated bile acid in stool samples from healthy adults (p{\textless}0.01). Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species. These associations could provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer environment and will help direct future mechanistic studies. Using integrated "omics" approaches may prove a useful tool in identifying functional groups of gastrointestinal bacteria and their associated metabolites as novel therapeutic and chemopreventive targets.},

This review summarizes recent evidence demonstrating the role and responses of the intestinal microbiota during colon tumorigenesis and the ability of dietary bioactive compounds and probiotics to impact colon health from the intestinal lumen to the epithelium and systemically. We first describe changes to the intestinal microbiome, metabolome, and epithelium associated with colon carcinogenesis. This is followed by a discussion of recent evidence indicating how specific classes of dietary bioactives, prebiotics, or probiotics affect colon carcinogenesis. Lastly, we briefly address the prospects of using multiple ‘omics’ techniques to integrate the effects of diet, host, and microbiota on colon tumorigenesis with the goal of more fully appreciating the interconnectedness of these systems and thus, how these approaches can be used to advance personalized nutrition strategies and nutrition research.},

Accumulative evidence supports the involvement of bacterial pathogens in the development of cancer.Bacteria can manipulate the biology of the cell directly through bacterial effectors that are capable of subverting oncogenic pathways or indirectly by the immune response and microbial metabolites.Genomic instability is an important hallmark of cancer cells and constitutes a first step towards tumour initiation. Bacteria can secrete toxins that induce DNA breaks in host cells and cause genomic instability.As part of their infection cycle, bacteria activate various host pathways that are also activated in cancer. These include the β-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K-AKT) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways. Activating these pathways may be a step in the process of cell transformation.Bacteria can promote local or systemic tumour-promoting effects through the modulation of the inflammatory response by, for example, producing radicals and secondary carcinogenic metabolites.Pathogenic infections or microbiota colonization increase the risk of tumour initiation by targeting several pathways at the same time. A better definition of bacterial contributions to cancer development may lead to strategies to prevent or control tumours.},

The presence of bacterial genes encoding genotoxic or pro-inflammatory factors (pks, tcpC, gelE, cnf-1, AMmurB, and usp) was established by PCR of stool samples from individuals from mainland US (n = 30; controls = 10, adenoma = 10, CRC = 10) and from Puerto Rico (PR) (n = 33; controls = 13; adenomas = 8; CRC = 12). Logistic regression models and multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate the magnitude of association. Distinct bacterial gene profiles were observed in each sample cohort. In individuals with CRC, AMmurB was detected more frequently in samples from the US and gelE in samples from PR. In samples from PR, individuals with \&ge;2 gut bacterial toxin genes in stool had higher odds of having colorectal neoplasia (OR = 11.0, 95\%: CI 1.0\&ndash;637.1): however, no significant association between bacterial genes and colorectal neoplasia was observed in the US cohort.

The bacterial toxin colibactin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and is associated with the occurrence of bacterially induced colorectal cancer in humans. However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks, which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks+E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane “warhead” breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks+E. coli.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONMembers of the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These CRC-associated microorganisms may influence carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of genotoxins. Colibactin is a genotoxic secondary metabolite made by organisms harboring the pks genomic island, including certain gut commensal Escherichia coli strains (pks+ E. coli). Transient infection of mammalian cells with pks+ E. coli causes cell cycle arrest, DNA double-strand breaks, and senescence. Moreover, colibactin-producing E. coli accelerate tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC and are overrepresented in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and CRC. Despite colibactin’s strong links to cancer, the active genotoxic metabolite has eluded all isolation attempts, limiting our mechanistic understanding of this association.
RATIONALEOver the past decade, multiple complementary approaches have provided indirect information about colibactin’s chemical structure. Interestingly, the isolation and structural characterization of metabolites from mutant strains of pks+ E. coli revealed that colibactin likely contains a cyclopropane ring, a reactive structural motif found in DNA alkylating natural products. This led us and others to hypothesize that colibactin may covalently modify DNA. To obtain information about the active genotoxin’s chemical structure and its mode of action, we sought to identify and structurally characterize colibactin-DNA adducts from human cells infected with pks+ E. coli.
RESULTSUsing untargeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry–based DNA adductomics, we compared the DNA adducts present in mammalian cell lines transiently infected with either pks+ E. coli or a mutant strain missing the pks genes. We discovered two adenine adducts that were specific to the cells exposed to pks+ E. coli. These adducts were confirmed to be pks-associated by feeding isotopic labeled versions of known colibactin biosynthetic precursors to the E. coli–mammalian cell system. The pks-dependent adducts were also found in human cells exposed to clinical colibactin-producing E. coli isolates and in the colonic epithelial cells of mice monocolonized with pks+ E. coli. Chemical synthesis and in vitro DNA alkylation reactions enabled the preparation of an authentic standard of the adducts. Structural characterization revealed a mixture of two diastereomeric adducts that both contain a 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one ring system with an attached N3-substituted adenine ring. These DNA adducts are generated from ring opening of a reactive, cyclopropane-containing electrophilic warhead, confirming the importance of this structural feature for colibactin’s in vivo activity. Because these adducts are too small to derive from the final colibactin structure, we hypothesize that they arise from decomposition of a larger, unstable colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-link. Using a CometChip assay, we detected interstrand cross-link formation in cells infected with pks+ E. coli at the same time point at which we identified the characterized DNA adducts, supporting this proposal.
CONCLUSIONOur results provide direct evidence that the gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo, providing mechanistic insights into how colibactin may contribute to CRC. The ability of pks+ E. coli to generate DNA adducts in mammalian cells and in mice strengthens support for the involvement of colibactin in cancer development or progression. Bulky DNA adducts, especially interstrand cross-links, are often cytotoxic and can lead to mutations if not accurately repaired. Colibactin-mediated DNA damage and the ensuing genomic instability could thus potentially be an underlying mediator of colorectal carcinogenesis. The colibactin-derived DNA adducts we identified could serve as a biomarker of pks+ E. coli exposure and will ultimately help to address the question of whether DNA damage inflicted by colibactin-producing gut bacteria contributes to CRC development and progression in humans. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6428/eaar7785/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Gut commensal E. coli strains associated with CRC produce a DNA-alkylating genotoxin.(Top) The cyclopropane ring found in pks-dependent metabolites led us to hypothesize that colibactin alkylates DNA.

These adducts also form in mice colonized with pks+ E. coli, confirming that colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo and strengthening its link to cancer.
Certain Escherichia coli strains residing in the human gut produce colibactin, a small-molecule genotoxin implicated in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. However, colibactin’s chemical structure and the molecular mechanism underlying its genotoxic effects have remained unknown for more than a decade. Here we combine an untargeted DNA adductomics approach with chemical synthesis to identify and characterize a covalent DNA modification from human cell lines treated with colibactin-producing E. coli. Our data establish that colibactin alkylates DNA with an unusual electrophilic cyclopropane. We show that this metabolite is formed in mice colonized by colibactin-producing E. coli and is likely derived from an initially formed, unstable colibactin-DNA adduct. Our findings reveal a potential biomarker for colibactin exposure and provide mechanistic insights into how a gut microbe may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.
DNA adducts in cells and animals exposed to colibactin-producing gut microbes shed light on the mode of action of a cancer-linked genotoxin.

An effective screening program leading to early detection of disease would severely reduce the mortality of CRC. Alterations in the gut microbiota have been linked to CRC, but the potential of microbial markers for use in CRC screening has been largely unstudied. We used a nested case–control study of 238 study subjects to explore the use of microbial markers for clbA+ bacteria harboring the pks pathogenicity island, afa-C+ diffusely adherent Escherichia coli harboring the afa-1 operon, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in stool as potential screening markers for CRC. We found that individual markers for clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum were more abundant in stool of patients with CRC, and could predict cancer with a relatively high specificity (81.5\% and 76.9\%, respectively) and with a sensitivity of 56.4\% and 69.2\%, respectively. In a combined test of clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum, CRC was detected with a specificity of 63.1\% and a sensitivity of 84.6\%. Our findings support a potential value of microbial factors in stool as putative noninvasive biomarkers for CRC detection. We propose that microbial markers may represent an important future screening strategy for CRC, selecting patients with a “high-risk” microbial pattern to other further diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy.},

A survey of somatic mutations at colibactin target sites of several thousand cancer genomes revealed notable enrichment of this motif in colorectal cancers.

Different microbial metabolites have the potential to promote and protect against colorectal cancer (CRC).Accumulating evidence suggests that microbial-derived short chain fatty acids control inflammation and regulatory T cell populations. This involves the inhibition of host histone deacetylases and interactions with cell surface receptors.Multiple species in the gut microbiota have complex roles in releasing and converting diet-derived phytochemicals and host-derived bile acids and glycoconjugates, all of which influence the overall microbial metabolome.Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota can be detected both in faecal samples and in tumour-associated communities that are associated with CRC. Although many of these changes may be consequential, some specific pathogens seem to contribute to causation and disease progression.It is unlikely that the aetiology of CRC can be ascribed to the presence and activities of single pathogenic species, and it is proposed that the cumulative effects of microbial metabolites should be considered to better predict and prevent cancer progression.},

On the one hand, many coexisting but taxonomically distinct microorganisms can encode the same energy-yielding metabolic functions, and this functional redundancy contrasts with the expectation that species should occupy distinct metabolic niches. On the other hand, the identity of taxa encoding each function can vary substantially across space or time with little effect on the function, and this taxonomic variability is frequently thought to result from ecological drift between equivalent organisms. Here, we synthesize the powerful paradigm emerging from these two patterns, connecting the roles of function, functional redundancy and taxonomy in microbial systems. We conclude that both patterns are unlikely to be the result of ecological drift, but are inevitable emergent properties of open microbial systems resulting mainly from biotic interactions and environmental and spatial processes.},

	abstract = {Results from microbiome studies on oral cancer have been inconsistent, probably because they focused on compositional analysis, which does not account for functional redundancy among oral bacteria. Based on functional prediction, a recent study revealed enrichment of inflammatory bacterial attributes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Given the high relevance of this finding to carcinogenesis, we aimed here to corroborate them in a case-control study involving 25 OSCC cases and 27 fibroepithelial polyp (FEP) controls from Sri Lanka. DNA extracted from fresh biopsies was sequenced for the V1 to V3 region with Illumina?s 2 ? 300?bp chemistry. High-quality nonchimeric merged reads were classified to the species level with a prioritized BLASTN-based algorithm. Downstream compositional analysis was performed with QIIME (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology) and linear discriminant analysis effect size, while PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) was utilized for bacteriome functional prediction. The OSCC tissues tended to have lower species richness and diversity. Genera Capnocytophaga, Pseudomonas, and Atopobium were overrepresented in OSCC, while Lautropia, Staphylococcus, and Propionibacterium were the most abundant in FEP. At the species level, Campylobacter concisus, Prevotella salivae, Prevotella loeschii, and Fusobacterium oral taxon 204 were enriched in OSCC, while Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oral taxon 070, Lautropia mirabilis, and Rothia dentocariosa among others were more abundant in FEP. Functionally, proinflammatory bacterial attributes, including lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and peptidases, were enriched in the OSCC tissues. Thus, while the results in terms of species composition significantly differed from the original study, they were consistent at the functional level, substantiating evidence for the inflammatory nature of the bacteriome associated with OSCC.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiome is a complex microbial community that plays a key role in human health. Diet is an important factor dictating gut microbiome composition. This is mediated by multiple microbe-microbe interactions that result in the fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids. Certain species play key metabolic roles in the microbiome, and their disappearance could result in dysbiosis. In this work, a synthetic consortium of 14 gut microbes was studied during the utilization of prebiotic inulin in batch bioreactors. Fermentations were repeated leaving one species out every time, in order to evaluate the impact of their elimination on the system. Substrate consumption, microbial composition, and metabolite production were determined. Single deletions never resulted in a complete loss of bacterial growth or inulin consumption, suggesting functional redundancy. Deletions of Bacteroides dorei and Lachnoclostridium clostridioforme resulted in lower biomass and higher residual inulin. The absence of B. dorei impacted the abundance of the other 10 species negatively. Lachnoclostridium symbiosum, a butyrate producer, appeared to be the most sensitive species to deletions, being stimulated by the presence of Escherichia coli, Biﬁdobacterium adolescentis, B. dorei, and Lactobacillus plantarum. Conversely, bioreactors without these species did not show butyrate production. L. clostridioforme was observed to be essential for propionate production, and B. dorei for lactate production. Our analysis identiﬁed speciﬁc members that were essential for the function of the consortium. In conclusion, species deletions from microbial consortia could be a useful approach to identify relevant interactions between microorganisms and deﬁning metabolic roles in the gut microbiome.},

Here, we propose an approach for quantifying functional redundancy that use ‘omics data. This approach, termed trait contribution evenness (TCE), is based on traditional measures of community diversity. We measure functional redundancy of a trait within a community as the evenness in relative contribution of that trait among taxa within the community. This definition has several appealing properties including: TCE is an extension of established diversity theory, functional redundancy measurements from communities with different richness and relative trait contribution by taxa are easily comparable, and any quantifiable trait data (genes copies, protein abundance, transcript copies, respiration rates, etc.) is suitable for analysis. Resilience of a trait to taxa extinctions is often viewed as an ecological consequence of traits with high functional redundancy. We demonstrate that TCE functional redundancy is closely and monotonically related to the resilience of a trait to extinctions of trait-bearing taxa. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of TCE, we analyzed the functional redundancy of eight nitrogen-transforming pathways using 2,631 metagenome-assembled genomes from 47 TARA Oceans sites. We found that the NH$_{\textrm{4}}$$^{\textrm{+}}$ assimilation pathway was the most functionally redundant (0.6 to 0.7) while nitrification had the lowest functional redundancy (0 to 0.1). Here, TCE functional redundancy addresses shortfalls of other functional redundancy measurements by providing a generalizable, quantitative, and comparable functional redundancy measurement.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Importance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The broad application of ‘omics technologies in microbiological studies highlights the necessity of integrating traditional ecological theory with omics data when quantifying community functional redundancy. Such an approach should allow for comparisons in functional redundancy between different samples, sites, and studies. Here, we propose measuring functional redundancy based on an expansion of already existing diversity theory. This approach measures how evenly different members in a community contribute to the overall level of a trait within a community. The utility in the approach proposed here will allow for broad evaluation of traits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
