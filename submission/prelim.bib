	abstract = {Clostridium difﬁcile is the largest single cause of hospital-acquired infection in the United States. A major risk factor for Clostridium difﬁcile infection (CDI) is prior exposure to antibiotics, as they disrupt the gut bacterial community which protects from C. difﬁcile colonization. Multiple antibiotic classes have been associated with CDI susceptibility, many leading to distinct community structures stemming from variation in bacterial targets of action. These community structures present separate metabolic challenges to C. difﬁcile. Therefore, we hypothesized that the pathogen adapts its physiology to the nutrients within different gut environments. Utilizing an in vivo CDI model, we demonstrated that C. difﬁcile highly colonized ceca of mice pretreated with any of three antibiotics from distinct classes. Levels of C. difﬁcile spore formation and toxin activity varied between animals based on the antibiotic pretreatment. These physiologic processes in C. difﬁcile are partially regulated by environmental nutrient concentrations. To investigate metabolic responses of the bacterium in vivo, we performed transcriptomic analysis of C. difﬁcile from ceca of infected mice across pretreatments. This revealed heterogeneous expression in numerous catabolic pathways for diverse growth substrates. To assess which resources C. difﬁcile exploited, we developed a genome-scale metabolic model with a transcriptome-enabled metabolite scoring algorithm integrating network architecture. This platform identiﬁed nutrients that C. difﬁcile used preferentially between pretreatments, which were validated through untargeted mass spectrometry of each microbiome. Our results supported the hypothesis that C. difﬁcile inhabits alternative nutrient niches across cecal microbiomes with increased preference for nitrogencontaining carbon sources, particularly Stickland fermentation substrates and hostderived glycans.},

Here we present resources from a population of 242 healthy adults sampled at 15 to 18 body sites up to three times, which to date, have generated 5,177 microbial taxonomic profiles from 16S rRNA genes and over 3.5 Tb of metagenomic sequence. In parallel, approximately 800 human-associated reference genomes have been sequenced. Collectively, these data represent the largest resource to date describing the abundance and variety of the human microbiome, while providing a platform for current and future studies.},

Our goal was to create a comprehensive package that allowed users to analyze amplicon sequence data using the most robust methods available. mothur has helped lead the community through the ongoing sequencing revolution and continues to provide this service to the microbial ecology community. Beyond its success and impact on the field, mothur's development exposed a series of observations that are generally translatable across science. Perhaps the observation that stands out the most is that all science is done in the context of prevailing ideas and available technologies. Although it is easy to criticize choices that were made 10 years ago through a modern lens, if we were to wait for all of the possible limitations to be solved before proceeding, science would stall. Even preceding the development of mothur, it was necessary to address the most important problems and work backwards to other problems that limited access to robust sequence analysis tools. At the same time, we strive to expand mothur's capabilities in a data-driven manner to incorporate new ideas and accommodate changes in data and desires of the research community. It has been edifying to see the benefit that a simple set of tools can bring to so many other researchers.},

This shift has required parallel modifications in methodology and techniques, including a substantive move toward untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics, although significant challenges limit the widespread use of metabolomic analysis for microbiome samples. Herein we describe parameters for LC-MS/MS sample handling, data acquisition, data analysis, and verification and related freely-available software that specifically impact analysis of complex microbial systems. Continued optimization of instrumentation, parameters, and software will allow metabolomics to more accurately represent chemical exchange in microbiome systems, providing enhanced understanding of their molecular potential.},

	abstract = {Obesity is an important and intractable public health problem. In addition to the well-known risk factors of behavior, diet, and genetics, gut microbial communities were recently identified as another possible source of risk and a potential therapeutic target. However, human and animal-model studies have yielded conflicting results about the precise nature of associations between microbiome composition and obesity. In this paper, we use publicly available data from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and MetaHIT, both surveys of healthy adults that include obese individuals, plus two smaller studies that specifically examined lean versus obese adults. We find that inter-study variability in the taxonomic composition of stool microbiomes far exceeds differences between lean and obese individuals within studies. Our analyses further reveal a high degree of variability in stool microbiome composition and diversity across individuals. While we confirm the previously published small, but statistically significant, differences in phylum-level taxonomic composition between lean and obese individuals in several cohorts, we find no association between BMI and taxonomic composition of stool microbiomes in the larger HMP and MetaHIT datasets. We explore a range of different statistical techniques and show that this result is robust to the choice of methodology. Differences between studies are likely due to a combination of technical and clinical factors. We conclude that there is no simple taxonomic signature of obesity in the microbiota of the human gut.},

A recent study revealed that in colon cancer, bacteria form polysaccharide matrices called biofilms at a high frequency in the proximal colon. Comprehensive untargeted and stable isotope-assisted metabolomic analysis revealed that the bacteria utilize polyamine metabolites produced from colon adenomas/carcinomas to build these protective biofilms and may contribute to inflammation and proliferation observed in colon cancer. This study highlighted the importance of finding the biological origin of a metabolite and assessing its metabolism and mechanism of action. This led to a better understanding of host and microbial interactions, thereby aiding therapeutic design for cancer. In this review, we will discuss methodologies for identifying the biological origin and roles of metabolites in cancer progression and discuss the interactions of the microbiome and metabolites in immunity and cancer treatment, focusing on the flourishing field of cancer immunotherapy.

	abstract = {In this study we used stool profiling to identify intestinal bacteria and metabolites that are differentially represented in humans with colorectal cancer (CRC) compared to healthy controls to identify how microbial functions may influence CRC development. Stool samples were collected from healthy adults (n = 10) and colorectal cancer patients (n = 11) prior to colon resection surgery at the University of Colorado Health-Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, CO. The V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene was pyrosequenced and both short chain fatty acids and global stool metabolites were extracted and analyzed utilizing Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). There were no significant differences in the overall microbial community structure associated with the disease state, but several bacterial genera, particularly butyrate-producing species, were under-represented in the CRC samples, while a mucin-degrading species, Akkermansia muciniphila, was about 4-fold higher in CRC (p{\textless}0.01). Proportionately higher amounts of butyrate were seen in stool of healthy individuals while relative concentrations of acetate were higher in stools of CRC patients. GC-MS profiling revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples from CRC patients and higher poly and monounsaturated fatty acids and ursodeoxycholic acid, a conjugated bile acid in stool samples from healthy adults (p{\textless}0.01). Correlative analysis between the combined datasets revealed some potential relationships between stool metabolites and certain bacterial species. These associations could provide insight into microbial functions occurring in a cancer environment and will help direct future mechanistic studies. Using integrated "omics" approaches may prove a useful tool in identifying functional groups of gastrointestinal bacteria and their associated metabolites as novel therapeutic and chemopreventive targets.},

This review summarizes recent evidence demonstrating the role and responses of the intestinal microbiota during colon tumorigenesis and the ability of dietary bioactive compounds and probiotics to impact colon health from the intestinal lumen to the epithelium and systemically. We first describe changes to the intestinal microbiome, metabolome, and epithelium associated with colon carcinogenesis. This is followed by a discussion of recent evidence indicating how specific classes of dietary bioactives, prebiotics, or probiotics affect colon carcinogenesis. Lastly, we briefly address the prospects of using multiple ‘omics’ techniques to integrate the effects of diet, host, and microbiota on colon tumorigenesis with the goal of more fully appreciating the interconnectedness of these systems and thus, how these approaches can be used to advance personalized nutrition strategies and nutrition research.},

	abstract = {Infections with bacteria, viruses and parasites are responsible for about 20\% of all human malignancies, but only one bacterium is formally recognized as a class I carcinogen. Accumulative evidence supports the involvement of bacterial pathogens in the development of cancer.Bacteria can manipulate the biology of the cell directly through bacterial effectors that are capable of subverting oncogenic pathways or indirectly by the immune response and microbial metabolites.Genomic instability is an important hallmark of cancer cells and constitutes a first step towards tumour initiation. Bacteria can secrete toxins that induce DNA breaks in host cells and cause genomic instability.As part of their infection cycle, bacteria activate various host pathways that are also activated in cancer. These include the β-catenin, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K-AKT) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathways. Activating these pathways may be a step in the process of cell transformation.Bacteria can promote local or systemic tumour-promoting effects through the modulation of the inflammatory response by, for example, producing radicals and secondary carcinogenic metabolites.Pathogenic infections or microbiota colonization increase the risk of tumour initiation by targeting several pathways at the same time. A better definition of bacterial contributions to cancer development may lead to strategies to prevent or control tumours.},

The bacterial toxin colibactin causes double-stranded DNA breaks and is associated with the occurrence of bacterially induced colorectal cancer in humans. However, isolation of colibactin is difficult, and its mode of action is poorly understood. Wilson et al. studied Escherichia coli that contain the biosynthetic gene island called pks, which is associated with colibactin production (see the Perspective by Bleich and Arthur). They identified the DNA adducts that resulted from incubating pks+E. coli in human cells. To overcome the lack of colibactin for direct analysis, mimics of the pks product were synthesized. From the resulting synthetic adenine-colibactin adducts, it became evident that alkylation via a cyclopropane “warhead” breaks the DNA strands. Similar DNA adducts were then identified in the gut epithelia of mice infected with pks+E. coli.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONMembers of the human gut microbiota have been implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). These CRC-associated microorganisms may influence carcinogenesis through a variety of mechanisms, including the production of genotoxins. Colibactin is a genotoxic secondary metabolite made by organisms harboring the pks genomic island, including certain gut commensal Escherichia coli strains (pks+ E. coli). Transient infection of mammalian cells with pks+ E. coli causes cell cycle arrest, DNA double-strand breaks, and senescence. Moreover, colibactin-producing E. coli accelerate tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colitis-associated CRC and are overrepresented in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis and CRC. Despite colibactin’s strong links to cancer, the active genotoxic metabolite has eluded all isolation attempts, limiting our mechanistic understanding of this association.
RATIONALEOver the past decade, multiple complementary approaches have provided indirect information about colibactin’s chemical structure. Interestingly, the isolation and structural characterization of metabolites from mutant strains of pks+ E. coli revealed that colibactin likely contains a cyclopropane ring, a reactive structural motif found in DNA alkylating natural products. This led us and others to hypothesize that colibactin may covalently modify DNA. To obtain information about the active genotoxin’s chemical structure and its mode of action, we sought to identify and structurally characterize colibactin-DNA adducts from human cells infected with pks+ E. coli.
RESULTSUsing untargeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry–based DNA adductomics, we compared the DNA adducts present in mammalian cell lines transiently infected with either pks+ E. coli or a mutant strain missing the pks genes. We discovered two adenine adducts that were specific to the cells exposed to pks+ E. coli. These adducts were confirmed to be pks-associated by feeding isotopic labeled versions of known colibactin biosynthetic precursors to the E. coli–mammalian cell system. The pks-dependent adducts were also found in human cells exposed to clinical colibactin-producing E. coli isolates and in the colonic epithelial cells of mice monocolonized with pks+ E. coli. Chemical synthesis and in vitro DNA alkylation reactions enabled the preparation of an authentic standard of the adducts. Structural characterization revealed a mixture of two diastereomeric adducts that both contain a 5-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-one ring system with an attached N3-substituted adenine ring. These DNA adducts are generated from ring opening of a reactive, cyclopropane-containing electrophilic warhead, confirming the importance of this structural feature for colibactin’s in vivo activity. Because these adducts are too small to derive from the final colibactin structure, we hypothesize that they arise from decomposition of a larger, unstable colibactin-DNA interstrand cross-link. Using a CometChip assay, we detected interstrand cross-link formation in cells infected with pks+ E. coli at the same time point at which we identified the characterized DNA adducts, supporting this proposal.
CONCLUSIONOur results provide direct evidence that the gut bacterial genotoxin colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo, providing mechanistic insights into how colibactin may contribute to CRC. The ability of pks+ E. coli to generate DNA adducts in mammalian cells and in mice strengthens support for the involvement of colibactin in cancer development or progression. Bulky DNA adducts, especially interstrand cross-links, are often cytotoxic and can lead to mutations if not accurately repaired. Colibactin-mediated DNA damage and the ensuing genomic instability could thus potentially be an underlying mediator of colorectal carcinogenesis. The colibactin-derived DNA adducts we identified could serve as a biomarker of pks+ E. coli exposure and will ultimately help to address the question of whether DNA damage inflicted by colibactin-producing gut bacteria contributes to CRC development and progression in humans. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6428/eaar7785/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Gut commensal E. coli strains associated with CRC produce a DNA-alkylating genotoxin.(Top) The cyclopropane ring found in pks-dependent metabolites led us to hypothesize that colibactin alkylates DNA.

These adducts also form in mice colonized with pks+ E. coli, confirming that colibactin alkylates DNA in vivo and strengthening its link to cancer.
Certain Escherichia coli strains residing in the human gut produce colibactin, a small-molecule genotoxin implicated in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. However, colibactin’s chemical structure and the molecular mechanism underlying its genotoxic effects have remained unknown for more than a decade. Here we combine an untargeted DNA adductomics approach with chemical synthesis to identify and characterize a covalent DNA modification from human cell lines treated with colibactin-producing E. coli. Our data establish that colibactin alkylates DNA with an unusual electrophilic cyclopropane. We show that this metabolite is formed in mice colonized by colibactin-producing E. coli and is likely derived from an initially formed, unstable colibactin-DNA adduct. Our findings reveal a potential biomarker for colibactin exposure and provide mechanistic insights into how a gut microbe may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis.
DNA adducts in cells and animals exposed to colibactin-producing gut microbes shed light on the mode of action of a cancer-linked genotoxin.

An effective screening program leading to early detection of disease would severely reduce the mortality of CRC. Alterations in the gut microbiota have been linked to CRC, but the potential of microbial markers for use in CRC screening has been largely unstudied. We used a nested case–control study of 238 study subjects to explore the use of microbial markers for clbA+ bacteria harboring the pks pathogenicity island, afa-C+ diffusely adherent Escherichia coli harboring the afa-1 operon, and Fusobacterium nucleatum in stool as potential screening markers for CRC. We found that individual markers for clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum were more abundant in stool of patients with CRC, and could predict cancer with a relatively high specificity (81.5\% and 76.9\%, respectively) and with a sensitivity of 56.4\% and 69.2\%, respectively. In a combined test of clbA+ bacteria and F. nucleatum, CRC was detected with a specificity of 63.1\% and a sensitivity of 84.6\%. Our findings support a potential value of microbial factors in stool as putative noninvasive biomarkers for CRC detection. We propose that microbial markers may represent an important future screening strategy for CRC, selecting patients with a “high-risk” microbial pattern to other further diagnostic procedures such as colonoscopy.},

Different microbial metabolites have the potential to promote and protect against colorectal cancer (CRC).Accumulating evidence suggests that microbial-derived short chain fatty acids control inflammation and regulatory T cell populations. This involves the inhibition of host histone deacetylases and interactions with cell surface receptors.Multiple species in the gut microbiota have complex roles in releasing and converting diet-derived phytochemicals and host-derived bile acids and glycoconjugates, all of which influence the overall microbial metabolome.Alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota can be detected both in faecal samples and in tumour-associated communities that are associated with CRC. Although many of these changes may be consequential, some specific pathogens seem to contribute to causation and disease progression.It is unlikely that the aetiology of CRC can be ascribed to the presence and activities of single pathogenic species, and it is proposed that the cumulative effects of microbial metabolites should be considered to better predict and prevent cancer progression.},

	abstract = {Microbial communities often exhibit incredible taxonomic diversity, raising questions regarding the mechanisms enabling species coexistence and the role of this diversity in community functioning. On the one hand, many coexisting but taxonomically distinct microorganisms can encode the same energy-yielding metabolic functions, and this functional redundancy contrasts with the expectation that species should occupy distinct metabolic niches. On the other hand, the identity of taxa encoding each function can vary substantially across space or time with little effect on the function, and this taxonomic variability is frequently thought to result from ecological drift between equivalent organisms. Here, we synthesize the powerful paradigm emerging from these two patterns, connecting the roles of function, functional redundancy and taxonomy in microbial systems. We conclude that both patterns are unlikely to be the result of ecological drift, but are inevitable emergent properties of open microbial systems resulting mainly from biotic interactions and environmental and spatial processes.},

	abstract = {Results from microbiome studies on oral cancer have been inconsistent, probably because they focused on compositional analysis, which does not account for functional redundancy among oral bacteria. Based on functional prediction, a recent study revealed enrichment of inflammatory bacterial attributes in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Given the high relevance of this finding to carcinogenesis, we aimed here to corroborate them in a case-control study involving 25 OSCC cases and 27 fibroepithelial polyp (FEP) controls from Sri Lanka. DNA extracted from fresh biopsies was sequenced for the V1 to V3 region with Illumina?s 2 ? 300?bp chemistry. High-quality nonchimeric merged reads were classified to the species level with a prioritized BLASTN-based algorithm. Downstream compositional analysis was performed with QIIME (Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology) and linear discriminant analysis effect size, while PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States) was utilized for bacteriome functional prediction. The OSCC tissues tended to have lower species richness and diversity. Genera Capnocytophaga, Pseudomonas, and Atopobium were overrepresented in OSCC, while Lautropia, Staphylococcus, and Propionibacterium were the most abundant in FEP. At the species level, Campylobacter concisus, Prevotella salivae, Prevotella loeschii, and Fusobacterium oral taxon 204 were enriched in OSCC, while Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus oral taxon 070, Lautropia mirabilis, and Rothia dentocariosa among others were more abundant in FEP. Functionally, proinflammatory bacterial attributes, including lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and peptidases, were enriched in the OSCC tissues. Thus, while the results in terms of species composition significantly differed from the original study, they were consistent at the functional level, substantiating evidence for the inflammatory nature of the bacteriome associated with OSCC.},

	abstract = {The gut microbiome is a complex microbial community that plays a key role in human health. Diet is an important factor dictating gut microbiome composition. This is mediated by multiple microbe-microbe interactions that result in the fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty acids. Certain species play key metabolic roles in the microbiome, and their disappearance could result in dysbiosis. In this work, a synthetic consortium of 14 gut microbes was studied during the utilization of prebiotic inulin in batch bioreactors. Fermentations were repeated leaving one species out every time, in order to evaluate the impact of their elimination on the system. Substrate consumption, microbial composition, and metabolite production were determined. Single deletions never resulted in a complete loss of bacterial growth or inulin consumption, suggesting functional redundancy. Deletions of Bacteroides dorei and Lachnoclostridium clostridioforme resulted in lower biomass and higher residual inulin. The absence of B. dorei impacted the abundance of the other 10 species negatively. Lachnoclostridium symbiosum, a butyrate producer, appeared to be the most sensitive species to deletions, being stimulated by the presence of Escherichia coli, Biﬁdobacterium adolescentis, B. dorei, and Lactobacillus plantarum. Conversely, bioreactors without these species did not show butyrate production. L. clostridioforme was observed to be essential for propionate production, and B. dorei for lactate production. Our analysis identiﬁed speciﬁc members that were essential for the function of the consortium. In conclusion, species deletions from microbial consortia could be a useful approach to identify relevant interactions between microorganisms and deﬁning metabolic roles in the gut microbiome.},

Here, we propose an approach for quantifying functional redundancy that use ‘omics data. This approach, termed trait contribution evenness (TCE), is based on traditional measures of community diversity. We measure functional redundancy of a trait within a community as the evenness in relative contribution of that trait among taxa within the community. This definition has several appealing properties including: TCE is an extension of established diversity theory, functional redundancy measurements from communities with different richness and relative trait contribution by taxa are easily comparable, and any quantifiable trait data (genes copies, protein abundance, transcript copies, respiration rates, etc.) is suitable for analysis. Resilience of a trait to taxa extinctions is often viewed as an ecological consequence of traits with high functional redundancy. We demonstrate that TCE functional redundancy is closely and monotonically related to the resilience of a trait to extinctions of trait-bearing taxa. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of TCE, we analyzed the functional redundancy of eight nitrogen-transforming pathways using 2,631 metagenome-assembled genomes from 47 TARA Oceans sites. We found that the NH$_{\textrm{4}}$$^{\textrm{+}}$ assimilation pathway was the most functionally redundant (0.6 to 0.7) while nitrification had the lowest functional redundancy (0 to 0.1). Here, TCE functional redundancy addresses shortfalls of other functional redundancy measurements by providing a generalizable, quantitative, and comparable functional redundancy measurement.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Importance{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The broad application of ‘omics technologies in microbiological studies highlights the necessity of integrating traditional ecological theory with omics data when quantifying community functional redundancy. Such an approach should allow for comparisons in functional redundancy between different samples, sites, and studies. Here, we propose measuring functional redundancy based on an expansion of already existing diversity theory. This approach measures how evenly different members in a community contribute to the overall level of a trait within a community. The utility in the approach proposed here will allow for broad evaluation of traits.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Using transplantation of human microbiomes into several animal models of infection, we show that key microbiome species shape the chemical environment of the gut through the activity of the enzyme bile salt hydrolase. The activity of this enzyme reduced colonization by the major human diarrheal pathogen Vibrio cholerae by degrading the bile salt taurocholate that activates the expression of virulence genes. The absence of these functions and species permits increased infection loads on a personal microbiome-speciﬁc basis.

Such information is precious for verifying, complementing or even integrating the results obtained with metagenomics. In fact, taxonomic accuracy is a crucial aspect of every meta-approach. A multitude of methods have been proposed aimed at extracting taxonomic/phylogenetic information from untargeted sequencing, with the aim of reconstructing and evaluating the genomic complexity of environments. Yet, methods for targeted taxonomic profiling, although relatively poor in terms of achievable taxonomic depth, can give a broader perspective on microbial populations with respect to metagenomics.

However, there is no all-purpose strategy that can guarantee the best result for a given project and there are several combinations of software, parameters and databases that can be tested. Therefore, we performed an impartial comparison, using statistical measures of classification for eight bioinformatic tools and four taxonomic databases, defining a benchmark framework to evaluate each tool in a standardized context. Using in silico simulated data for 16S rRNA amplicons and whole metagenome shotgun data, we compared the results from different software and database combinations to detect biases related to algorithms or database annotation. Using our benchmark framework, researchers can define cut-off values to evaluate the expected error rate and coverage for their results, regardless the score used by each software. A quick guide to select the best tool, all datasets and scripts to reproduce our results and benchmark any new method are available at https://github.com/Ales-ibt/Metagenomic-benchmark.

Several methods for taxonomic classification of bacterial sequences are discussed. We present simulations to assess the number of sequences that are required to perform reliable appraisals of bacterial community structure. To the extent that fluctuations in the diversity of gut bacterial populations correlate with health and disease, we emphasize various techniques for the analysis of bacterial communities within samples (α-diversity) and between samples (β-diversity).

	abstract = {Recent research has disclosed a tight connection between obesity, metabolic gut microbial activities and host health. Obtaining a complete understanding of this relationship remains a major goal. Here, we conducted a comparative metagenomic and metaproteomic investigation of gut microbial communities in faecal samples taken from an obese and a lean adolescent. By analysing the diversity of 16S rDNA amplicons (10\% operational phylogenetic units being common), 22 Mbp of consensus metagenome sequences (∼ 70\% common) and the expression profiles of 613 distinct proteins (82\% common), we found that in the obese gut, the total microbiota was more abundant on the phylum Firmicutes (94.6\%) as compared with Bacteroidetes (3.2\%), although the metabolically active microbiota clearly behaves in a more homogeneous manner with both contributing equally. The lean gut showed a remarkable shift towards Bacteroidetes (18.9\% total 16S rDNA), which become the most active fraction (81\% proteins). Although the two gut communities maintained largely similar gene repertoires and functional profiles, improved pili- and flagella-mediated host colonization and improved capacity for both complementary aerobic and anaerobic de novo B12 synthesis, 1,2-propanediol catabolism (most likely participating in de novo B12 synthesis) and butyrate production were observed in the obese gut, whereas bacteria from lean gut seem to be more engaged in vitamin B6 synthesis. Furthermore, this study provides functional evidence that variable combinations of species from different phyla could ‘presumptively’ fulfil overlapping and/or complementary functional roles required by the host, a scenario where minor bacterial taxa seem to be significant active contributors.},

	abstract = {The rock-hosted subseafloor crustal aquifer harbors a reservoir of microbial life that may influence global marine biogeochemical cycles. Here we utilized metagenomic libraries of crustal fluid samples from North Pond, located on the flanks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a site with cold, oxic subseafloor fluid circulation within the upper basement to query microbial diversity. Twenty-one samples were collected during a 2-year period to examine potential microbial metabolism and community dynamics. We observed minor changes in the geochemical signatures over the 2 years, yet the microbial community present in the crustal fluids underwent large shifts in the dominant taxonomic groups. An analysis of 195 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were generated from the data set and revealed a connection between litho- and autotrophic processes, linking carbon fixation to the oxidation of sulfide, sulfur, thiosulfate, hydrogen, and ferrous iron in members of the Proteobacteria, specifically the Alpha-, Gamma- and Zetaproteobacteria, the Epsilonbacteraeota and the Planctomycetes. Despite oxic conditions, analysis of the MAGs indicated that members of the microbial community were poised to exploit hypoxic or anoxic conditions through the use of microaerobic cytochromes, such as cbb3- and bd-type cytochromes, and alternative electron acceptors, like nitrate and sulfate. Temporal and spatial trends from the MAGs revealed a high degree of functional redundancy that did not correlate with the shifting microbial community membership, suggesting functional stability in mediating subseafloor biogeochemical cycles. Collectively, the repeated sampling at multiple sites, together with the successful binning of hundreds of genomes, provides an unprecedented data set for investigation of microbial communities in the cold, oxic crustal aquifer.},

Differences were detected between NT and CT in some functional subsystems, e.g., NT had more sequences associated with the metabolism of aromatic compounds, which might be related to higher capacity to degrade pesticides, more sequences of the adenylate cyclase (cAMP) pathway, which might confer stability to the microbial community, among others. On the other hand, CT showed more sequences related to carbohydrate metabolism, what could be related with a lower content of organic matter and need to metabolize a broader range of carbon sources. Also, we detected differences related to crop management, e.g., crop rotation showed more sequences in the metabolism of amino acids and derivatives and carbohydrate subsystems, what might result from higher diversity of crop-residues added to the soil. However, it was notable that the differences in the diversity of taxa previously shown in the same experiment was far greater than the functional diversity reported now, emphasizing a high level of microbial functional redundancy.},

	abstract = {Human viruses (those that infect human cells) have been associated with many cancers, largely due to their mutagenic and functionally manipulative abilities. Despite this, cancer microbiome studies have focused almost exclusively on bacteria instead of viruses. We began evaluating the cancer virome by focusing on colorectal cancer, a primary cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world and a cancer linked to altered colonic bacterial community compositions but with an unknown association with the gut virome. We used 16S rRNA gene, whole shotgun metagenomic, and purified virus metagenomic sequencing of stool to evaluate the differences in human colorectal cancer virus and bacterial community composition. Through random forest modeling, we identified differences in the healthy and colorectal cancer viromes. The cancer-associated virome consisted primarily of temperate bacteriophages that were also predicted to be bacterium-virus community network hubs. These results provide foundational evidence that bacteriophage communities are associated with colorectal cancer and potentially impact cancer progression by altering the bacterial host communities.
IMPORTANCE Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States and worldwide. Its risk and severity have been linked to colonic bacterial community composition. Although human-specific viruses have been linked to other cancers and diseases, little is known about colorectal cancer virus communities. We addressed this knowledge gap by identifying differences in colonic virus communities in the stool of colorectal cancer patients and how they compared to bacterial community differences. The results suggested an indirect role for the virome in impacting colorectal cancer by modulating the associated bacterial community. These findings both support the idea of a biological role for viruses in colorectal cancer and provide a new understanding of basic colorectal cancer etiology.},

	abstract = {Although it is generally accepted that plant community composition is key for predicting rates of ecosystem processes in the face of global change, microbial community composition is often ignored in ecosystem modeling. To address this issue, we review recent experiments and assess whether microbial community composition is resistant, resilient, or functionally redundant in response to four different disturbances. We find that the composition of most microbial groups is sensitive and not immediately resilient to disturbance, regardless of taxonomic breadth of the group or the type of disturbance. Other studies demonstrate that changes in composition are often associated with changes in ecosystem process rates. Thus, changes in microbial communities due to disturbance may directly affect ecosystem processes. Based on these relationships, we propose a simple framework to incorporate microbial community composition into ecosystem process models. We conclude that this effort would benefit from more empirical data on the links among microbial phylogeny, physiological traits, and disturbance responses. These relationships will determine how readily microbial community composition can be used to predict the responses of ecosystem processes to global change.},

In particular, library sizes often vary over several ranges of magnitude, and the data contains many zeros. Although we are typically interested in comparing relative abundance of taxa in the ecosystem of two or more groups, we can only measure the taxon relative abundance in specimens obtained from the ecosystems. Because the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the specimen is not equivalent to the comparison of taxon relative abundance in the ecosystems, this presents a special challenge. Second, because the relative abundance of taxa in the specimen (as well as in the ecosystem) sum to 1, these are compositional data. Because the compositional data are constrained by the simplex (sum to 1) and are not unconstrained in the Euclidean space, many standard methods of analysis are not applicable. Here, we evaluate how these challenges impact the performance of existing normalization methods and differential abundance analyses.},

	abstract = {BackgroundUnderstanding the factors regulating our microbiota is important but requires appropriate statistical methodology. When comparing two or more populations most existing approaches either discount the underlying compositional structure in the microbiome data or use probability models such as the multinomial and Dirichlet-multinomial distributions, which may impose a correlation structure not suitable for microbiome data.ObjectiveTo develop a methodology that accounts for compositional constraints to reduce false discoveries in detecting differentially abundant taxa at an ecosystem level, while maintaining high statistical power.MethodsWe introduced a novel statistical framework called analysis of composition of microbiomes (ANCOM). ANCOM accounts for the underlying structure in the data and can be used for comparing the composition of microbiomes in two or more populations. ANCOM makes no distributional assumptions and can be implemented in a linear model framework to adjust for covariates as well as model longitudinal data. ANCOM also scales well to compare samples involving thousands of taxa.ResultsWe compared the performance of ANCOM to the standard t-test and a recently published methodology called Zero Inflated Gaussian (ZIG) methodology (1) for drawing inferences on the mean taxa abundance in two or more populations. ANCOM controlled the false discovery rate (FDR) at the desired nominal level while also improving power, whereas the t-test and ZIG had inflated FDRs, in some instances as high as 68\% for the t-test and 60\% for ZIG. We illustrate the performance of ANCOM using two publicly available microbial datasets in the human gut, demonstrating its general applicability to testing hypotheses about compositional differences in microbial communities.ConclusionAccounting for compositionality using log-ratio analysis results in significantly improved inference in microbiota survey data.},
